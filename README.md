# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Classic rock paper scissors game I did as a practice project.
In this game you play against a computer and you can choose which hand you want to play as.
You must score up to 3 points to win a match.
If you win a single match you get 50 credits, and if the computer wins - you lose 50 credits.
